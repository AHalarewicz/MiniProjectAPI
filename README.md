# QuandlAPI
Practice working with the Quandl API, a widely used aggregator of financial market data.

# Summary
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an ability to interact with an API to obtain requested data.
Once the desired data is obtained, data wrangling techniques are applied to further understand statistical features of the data. 

Once a dictionary is created from the json data, each task
is coded to compile and run independently from other tasks.
